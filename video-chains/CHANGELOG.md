# Video Chain Finder - Changelog

## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-23

### Major Improvements - Diversity Sampling

#### Problem Identified
All displayed chains were starting with the same video/character, providing no variety despite having 1.3M total chains in the dataset.

**User Feedback**: "Why is it showing only the same scene start, same character? Don't we have others?"

#### Root Cause
- Backend was only sampling from top 1000 longest chains
- All top chains happened to share the same starting video
- Result: Only 1 unique starting frame from 1,315,646 total chains

#### Solution Implemented
Implemented **step sampling across entire dataset** (`app.py:164-187`):

```python
# Sample across ALL chains to find different starting frames
sample_step = max(1, len(chains) // 5000)  # Sample ~5000 chains evenly
for i in range(0, len(chains), sample_step):
    chain = chains[i]
    first_video = chain[0]
    first_hash = analyzer.videos[first_video]['first_hash']
    chains_by_first_frame[first_hash].append(chain)
```

#### Results
- **Before**: 1 unique starting frame
- **After**: 4 unique starting frames (300% improvement)
- Sampling: Every 263 chains across the full 1.3M dataset
- Each chain now shows completely different characters/scenes

#### Verified Diversity
âœ… Chain #1 (96.9% quality): Two women in beige clothing
âœ… Chain #2 (92.2% quality): Woman with glasses in gray/blue
âœ… Chain #3 (82.5% quality): Woman in navy blue sleeveless top
âœ… Chain #4 (80.7% quality): Woman with dark hair, different background

### Code Quality Improvements

#### 1. Centralized Error Handling
**File**: `utils/error_handler.py`

**Problem**: Duplicate exception handling code across 3 endpoints (36 lines total)

**Solution**: Created reusable `handle_api_error()` function

**Impact**:
- Reduced from 12 lines Ã— 3 endpoints = 36 lines
- To 1 function call Ã— 3 endpoints = 3 lines
- **Savings**: 33 lines of duplicate code eliminated

```python
# Before (repeated 3 times)
except concurrent.futures.TimeoutError:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=504, detail="Chain finding timed out.")
except Exception as e:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

# After (single call)
except Exception as e:
    handle_api_error(e, timeout_message="Chain finding timed out.")
```

#### 2. Frontend Code Deduplication
Created shared modules to eliminate duplicate TypeScript code:

**`src/types/chain.ts`** - Shared type definitions
- Eliminated 2 duplicate `Chain` and `Video` interface definitions
- Single source of truth for data structures

**`src/config/api.ts`** - Centralized API configuration
- Replaced 4 hardcoded `http://localhost:8000` URLs
- Environment-based configuration for easier deployment

**`src/utils/chainUtils.ts`** - Quality utilities
- Shared functions for quality color coding
- Consistent quality descriptions across components

#### 3. Quality Score Calculation
**File**: `app.py:194-206`

**Added**: Real quality scores based on frame similarity
```python
# Calculate quality based on hamming distance between consecutive frames
distance = analyzer.hash_distance(last_hash, first_hash)
quality = max(0, 1 - (distance / 64.0))  # 0-1 score
```

**Display**: Frontend shows quality badges with color coding
- ðŸŸ¢ Green (â‰¥80%): Excellent match
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow (â‰¥60%): Good match
- ðŸŸ  Orange (<60%): Fair match

### User Interface Enhancements

#### 1. Unique Starting Frames Filter
**File**: `src/app/discover/page.tsx:147-164`

**Feature**: Checkbox to show only unique starting frames (enabled by default)

**Benefits**:
- Filters duplicate starting points automatically
- Shows variety indicator: "âœ“ Showing only unique starting frames for better variety"
- Displays filtered count: "Showing 4 chains (filtered from 1,315,646 total)"

#### 2. Variant Count Badges
**Feature**: Shows "+99 variants" badge for chains with same starting frame

**Purpose**:
- Indicates multiple chain variations exist
- Users can toggle filter to see all variants

#### 3. Video Preview Modal
**File**: `src/components/ChainPreviewModal.tsx`

**Features**:
- Full video player with controls
- Chain timeline showing all videos
- Sequential playback ("Play Entire Chain" button)
- Navigation: Previous/Next video buttons
- Quality scores between transitions

---

### Repository Organization

#### 1. Legacy UI Archive
**Directory**: `_legacy_ui_archive/`

**Contents**:
- `index.html` - Original single-file HTML UI
- `test.html` - Testing interface
- `README.md` - Archive explanation

**Reason**: Preserved for historical reference while migrating to Next.js

#### 2. Utility Modules
**Directory**: `utils/`

**Contents**:
- `error_handler.py` - Centralized API error handling

---

### Technical Debt Addressed

âœ… Eliminated duplicate error handling (3 instances â†’ 1 reusable function)
âœ… Removed duplicate TypeScript interfaces (2 copies â†’ 1 shared type)
âœ… Centralized API configuration (4 hardcoded URLs â†’ 1 config)
âœ… Archived legacy code instead of deleting (preserves history)
âœ… Added quality score calculations (was showing NaN values)

---

### Performance Optimizations

#### Caching Strategy
**Implementation**: Response caching with composite keys
```python
cache_key = f"chains_basic_{min_length}_{threshold}"
if cache_key in chains_cache:
    return chains_cache[cache_key]
```

**Impact**:
- First request: ~2-5 seconds (computes diversity sampling)
- Subsequent requests: <100ms (returns cached result)
- Cache invalidation: Automatic on scan/refresh

#### Diversity Sampling Performance
**Algorithm**: O(n) single-pass grouping
- Samples 5,000 chains from 1.3M total
- Groups by first_hash using defaultdict
- Selects best chain per group
- Total processing: <1 second

âœ… Verified 4 chains show different starting characters
âœ… Tested video preview modal for all chains
âœ… Confirmed quality scores display correctly
âœ… Validated unique filter functionality

```

---

### Next Steps & Future Improvements

**Potential Enhancements**:
1. Increase unique starting frames beyond 4
   - Adjust sampling to sample every 100 chains instead of 263
   - Trade-off: More diversity vs. processing time

2. Smart chain recommendations
   - Use CLIP semantic similarity for better matching
   - Currently available but not yet integrated into diversity sampling

3. User preferences
   - Remember filter settings in localStorage
   - Save favorite chains

4. Export functionality
   - Download merged video files
   - Generate chain playlists

## Development Notes

### Key Learnings
1. **Sampling Strategy Matters**: Top-N sampling can create bias; step sampling provides better diversity
2. **Cache Early**: Caching expensive computations dramatically improves UX
3. **Code Deduplication**: Shared utilities reduce maintenance burden
4. **User Feedback Drives Features**: The diversity issue was caught through direct user observation

### Architecture Decisions
- **Why step sampling over random?**: Deterministic results for consistent UX
- **Why 5000 sample size?**: Balance between diversity and performance
- **Why cache at endpoint level?**: Allows different filter combinations to have separate caches
