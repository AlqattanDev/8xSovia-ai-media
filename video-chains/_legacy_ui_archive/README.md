# Legacy UI Archive

This directory contains the old HTML-based UI that was replaced by the modern Next.js interface.

## Why Archived?

The legacy UI (`index.html`) was deprecated and replaced with a modern Next.js application located in:
`/Users/alialqattan/Downloads/8xSovia/video-chains-modern/`

## What Was Changed?

1. **Port Configuration**: Old UI was trying to connect to port 8001 (incorrect)
2. **CSS Path**: Had incorrect static file path
3. **User Experience**: Basic HTML vs modern React with TypeScript

## Modern UI Location

The new, active UI is at:
- **Directory**: `../video-chains-modern/`
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4
